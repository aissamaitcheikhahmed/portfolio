  <h2 class="title">Rubric System - Hogent Academic Project</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">
    This project was developed as part of my Hogent opleiding, in collaboration with my coordinator. It is a well-structured, secure academic evaluation platform built with a .NET C# backend (using SQL Server, Entity Framework, JWT authentication, and MVC architecture) and a modern React TypeScript frontend. The system is designed for maintainability, scalability, and robust role-based access control.

    <h4>Project Note</h4>
    <p>
      I worked on this project with a strong focus on clean architecture, security (JWT), and best practices in both backend (.NET C#, SQL Server, Entity Framework, MVC) and frontend (React, TypeScript). The result is a robust, maintainable, and secure academic evaluation platform.
